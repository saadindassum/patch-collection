# To back up your patches
IMPORTANT: Always check the integrity of your patches. Make sure the size makes sense. You're working with an old machine. As cool as it is, it's prone to errors.

## To check the integrity of your patches
Each block (1-32) is about 4kb in size. Sometimes a big more. If the file you transferred in from the device is not 4kb, that's a red flag.

If you have a block you don't care about (say you haven't used 33-64), use it to try to load the block you just backed up. If it doesn't work, the backup is not valid.

# CSV Manuals
I created these since my first backup of the DX7s went horribly wrong. These files basically have values for all parameters on different patches. First I lay out the univeral settings (so the ones that affect all operators), then go into operator specifics, then into performance edits. These are great to go through and set up yourself if you wanna learn more about the synth.
