# To back up your patches
IMPORTANT: Always check the integrity of your patches. Make sure the size makes sense. You're working with an old machine. As cool as it is, it's prone to errors.

## To check the integrity of your patches
Each block (1-32) is about 4kb in size. Sometimes a big more. If the file you transferred in from the device is not 4kb, that's a red flag.

If you have a block you don't care about (say you haven't used 33-64), use it to try to load the block you just backed up. If it doesn't work, the backup is not valid.
