It looks like I shot myself in the foot real hard. Here are the patches I remember so we can recreate them.
As I find them in sessions I'll keep adding to this list.

13. Baby Bowser
14. Sancuatry (Funny sound from Earthbound)
    -Alg 14
    -Oscillator 1 was at 44 output, modulated by 2 at 2.00 freq. That's what caused it to be bright.
15. Tears Bass
16. 8-bit harp
    -One carrier for bass sound, one carrier for click. Curve for click loudness to prevent it from getting too loud.
    -Trick on the click is to have a constant frequency for the modulator on the click. Then the fine frequency of one of the modulator waves. I remember the sweetspot was somewhere between 17 and 21.
